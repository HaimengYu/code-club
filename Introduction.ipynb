    "As most of you are starting from 0, I am going to be as intuitive as I can, and that means skipping over the details and just show you how it works. For example, I'll show you how to solve a consumption optimization problem without explaining the theorems that pin down existence/convergence. The fun thing about computation is that most of the time those theorems do not exist or are very difficult to prove, so we can just try and see if we can reach a solution. \n",

If you are still stuck, I'll first ask to to ask other people in the course - more on this later - and then ask me. But I'm your last resort. When coding by yourself in the future there is only going to be [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), google and you.\n",

    "## 1. What is computer programming and what can it do for economists? <a id=\"part-1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is how to communicate a set of instructions to a computer in order to perform a computation - to solve a problem: sum a set of numbers, find a certain word in a text, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a do file in stata: a set of instructions for the computer to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of computers over people is that they are very very fast at doing simple math operations. They are also very fast and precise for more complex operations (like integration), but the way they do that is approximating the real thing using very simple math. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: Think about integration as the area behind a function. The way the computer computes that area is to split it up in many rectangles, caculate their areas and add them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the computer a powerful ally for doing tedious math. You have already seen in econometrics how good it can be for doing matrix algebra. Imaging doing OLS by hand! But for more complicated macro models, all that we need to do is reformulate our problems in such a way that all the computer has to do is (many) simple calculations. How? Well, that's why we macroeconomists love Bellman equations and value functions - breaking down complex problems into simpler ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In economics, most of the time we need to solve for an unknown function. Solving for a function is much more complicated than solving for a number! Most of the time, there is no close form solution and then pen and paper are mostly useless. But we can ask the computer to approximate those functions numerically. There are different ways of doing these: we can get the values of the unkown function $y(x)$ for certain values of $x$ and then \"connect the dots\" (interpolation) or fit a polynomial to pass though those points (collocation). Or if we are interested in the values around a certain point (the steady state for example), we can approximate the unknown function around that point using taylor rule expansions (perturbation).\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, in the neoclassical model, we saw how difficult was to obtain the saddle path, which is an unkown function $c(k)$ (I dropped the tildes). We could approximate it by hand using linearization, but that would take a long time and be very error prone. We did better by approximated it by shooting: starting at a level $k_0$ and an initial guess for $c_0$, then adjusting $c_0$ up or down until we hit the steady-state. We used the path generated by that sequence of $c$ and $k$ to generate a function - just connecting the dots (interpolation).\n",
    "\n",
    "But perhaps the most useful thing computers allows us to do is to estimate our models and take them to the data. usually we do this by giving an initial guess for the parameters of our model, solving it and then measuring the distance of certain statistics/outcomes of the model with their counterpart in the data. Most likely they won't be the same, but the computer can use clever algorithms (or mathematical recipies) like the [Newton method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) to find which way to change our parameters such that the distance with between model and the data is minimized. This is estimation/calibration, and applies to an even wider range of problems. From labour to finance, macro to matching, anyone that does an economic empirical application these days is using a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: In a macro model such as DSGE models, usually these are the variance of GDP, unemployment, wages, inflation, interest rates, investment, consumption, government spending... and their covariances.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Or in a labour model, the variance and persistence of unemployment, vacancies, job creation and job destrution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general procedure is: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve your model using a set of initial guesses for your parameters (risk aversion, depreciation etc) $\\theta_0$\n",
    "2. Calculate a set of statistics (moments) of interest (your \"targets\"). Call these $M(\\theta_0)$. \n",
    "3. Calculate then the norm (or the sum of square residuals or any other distance measure) between those and their data counterparts, $\\|(M(\\theta_0)-M_{TRUE})\\|$ \n",
    "4. Guess a new set of parameters (using some clever algorithm) $\\theta_1$ and back to 1.\n",
    "5. Stop when the distance is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes very fancy econometrics are used, like bayesian inference, GMM or VARs - don't worry if you don't know what some of these are, I said *fancy* econometrics  for a reason. These are rarely something that you can call a command in stata and be done with it - well, less so in R. Most of the time you will have to code your own estimators. If that sounds daunting to you that's ok. We won't be doing that in this course. But this shows you that even for econometrics knowing a bit of programming is extremly handy.\n",

The nicest thing is that both languages are fairly similar and the transition is very easy. So yeah, you are not going to learn not one but TWO programming languages.
