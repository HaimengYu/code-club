1. Download Anaconda

 From https://www.continuum.io/downloads. Choose python 2.7 .

 If during installation asks you if you want to add it to your system path, click yes.

2. Install seaborn

 Once the installation of Anaconda is complete, open a command prompt (terminal in mac), type in `pip install seaborn` and hit enter/return. 

 If you can't find your terminal/command promt, use your search bar.

 If it gives you an error, I'll try to fix it in class.

3. Install a good text editor (not necessary but highly recommended) 

 This is a must for anyone doing programming. I like Sublime 3.0 (https://www.sublimetext.com/3), but there are a few. Choose one with text highliting!

4. Set up GitHub

 Create an account in https://github.com/

 Download the desktop app from https://desktop.github.com/ 

 Don't pay too much attention to the github tutorials, I'll teach you how to use it in the first session. 

5. Download the materials (optional): 

 Go to the course github (https://github.com/crisla/code-club) and click on "fork". 

 Open your desktop GitHub (the program you just downloaded), log in and click on the plus sign. 

 Choose "clone" => "code-club" (NOT "crisla/code-club"!) => "clone code-club" and choose a place in your comptuer. 

Now you can find that folder in your computer and look at all the content!

To open this (or any other notebook) open the command prompt/terminal and navigate to the folder where the notebook is by typing `cd folder-path`. So for example, if it is in you documents, type `cd Documents/folder`.

Once there, type in `ipython notebook`. Your internet browser should open. Give it some time.
